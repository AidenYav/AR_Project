Known Issues/bugs:
    
    "Blocks" can be stacked ontop of each other when snapping together. 
    This will hopefully be fixed by pushing all subseqent blocks down or the last dragged block to the bottom of the program chain.
  
    Mobile compatibility is still broken as dragging blocks are also misread for other mobile phone inputs. 
    This will likely be fixed by improving UI placement/layout
  
    Placement of the "workspace" is pushed off screen when using mobile devices.
    Currently unknown what causes this bug, however, a restructure of the html/css layout may prove to be a solution.


Planned Updates:
  
    Improved UI
      UI more intuitive/instructive
      UI made more colorful, readable, and unique
  
    Level system
      Level Selection
      Puzzle completion effect
      New "maps"/puzles to play
  
    Model replaced with a unique drivable "robot" (will be based on a real life model)
